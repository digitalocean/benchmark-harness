export const DSQA_GRADER_PROMPT = `Your task is to evaluate whether a given "AI Response" for a specific "User Prompt" arrived at the correct answer.

**Answer Correctness Task**

*   **Purpose:** Assess whether the AI response provides the correct answer(s) based on the provided "Correct Answer" and "Prompt Type".
*   **Process:**
    *   Identify the "Prompt Type": "<prompt_type>".
    *   Refer to the "Correct Answer": "<answer>".
    *   Based on the "Prompt Type", determine if the "AI Response" contains the expected answer(s).
        *   **'Single Answer'**: Check if the response provides the answer that addresses the user's question. It does not have to match the exact wording of the provided answer.
        *   **'Set Answer'**: Check if the response includes *each* item from the provided ground truth answers. The order might not matter unless specified otherwise. The response might include more answers than the list. Determine the correctness *only* based on the list first and then check if the response includes answers not in the list.
    *   **Explanation:** Provide a brief explanation justifying your assessment of answer correctness, referencing specific parts of the AI response and the correct answer.
    *   **Correctness Details:** Provide a dictionary, one key for each expected answer part, and value is a boolean indicating whether each expected answer part was found.
        *   For 'Set Answer', this will be a list of attributes, one for each item/part in the "Correct Answer". Each key will be a string indicating the expected answer part, and the value will be a boolean indicating whether that part was found in the response.
    *   **Excessive Answers:** Provide a list of strings, each indicating an excessive answer part. If the response provides answers that are **not** in the "Correct Answer" list, add these answers as excessive answers. Return an empty list when there's no excessive answers in the response.


**Output Format:**

Your evaluation *must* be structured as a nested JSON dictionary with the following top-level keys: \`"Answer Correctness"\`. Please return NULL if any of "Prompt", "AI Response" or "Correct Answer" is empty.
The value for \`"Answer Correctness"\` should be a dictionary containing \`"Explanation"\` (a string), \`"Correctness Details"\` (a dictionary where each key is the expected correct answer, and the value is a boolean indicating whether the response contains the correct answer), and \`"Excessive Answers"\` (a list of strings indicating the excessive answers).

Make sure you return a valid JSON string. Pay special attention to quotes, commas and special characters in the JSON string. Make sure to escape all special characters and quotes in the JSON string.


**Example (Partial):**

"\`\`\`json
{
  "Answer Correctness": {
    "Explanation": "The response correctly identified Belgium and France but also includes an excessive answer, Italy.",
    "Correctness Details": {
      "Belgium": true,
      "France": true,
    },
    "Excessive Answers": [ "Italy" ]
  }
}
\`\`\`"

**Now, proceed with the evaluation using the provided User Prompt, AI Response, and Correct Answer.**

User Prompt (Wrapped in <prompt> and </prompt>):
<prompt>
{prompt}
</prompt>
--------------------
**  Correct Answer (Wrapped in <answer> and </answer>):
Prompt Type: {prompt_type}
<answer>
{answer}
</answer>
--------------------
AI assistant response (Wrapped in <response> and </response>):
<response>
{response}
</response>
